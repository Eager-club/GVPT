    <h1>Institute Distinctiveness</h1>
    <p>Gayatri Vidya Parishad College for Degree and PG Courses(A) (GVPCDPGC(A)) has always focused its efforts to integrate student learning experience with development of the community. Besides including components in the regular curriculum to provide an opportunity to comprehend problems in the community through different courses addressing the local and regional needs, field visits are arranged for the students to nearby rural/tribal areas for a wider exposure.</p>
    
    <p>As a part of this since 2016, faculty and students of GVPCDPGC involved in organizing hundreds of health camps in and around Hukumpeta and Paderu mandals of ASR District serving thousands of tribal people. During these camps, it has been observed that there is a need for the enhancement of livelihood and standard of living Tribals in this region.</p>

    <p>With a vision to promote need based, region specific development programs in tribal areas, with a view to help tribal people to move towards new horizons of prosperity and with a mission to be a catalyst in the integrated development of tribal people through appropriate programmes in Science, Engineering, Healthcare and Business models without disturbing their identity and culture, focused initiatives have been planned in association with Tribal welfare Dept. and District administration.</p>
    
    <p>As part of this Baseline survey was conducted covering about 3600 households in 33 gram panchayats, in Hukumpeta Mandal, ASR District. The Following problems have been identified during this survey:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Lack of knowledge on scientific methods of cultivation</li>
        <li>Identified low hemoglobin levels in 65% the people</li>
        <li>Poor infrastructure, warehousing facilities and market linkages</li>
        <li>Lack of knowledge on soil health conditions, value addition adoption of modern technology and digital knowledge to communicate with agricultural and market expert</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Among all the above, the most critical problem noticed was that 65% of the people were suffering from low levels of Haemoglobin (Anaemia) in the Tribal villages. Then, a plan of action has been formulated to address this issue. As a part of this plan, GVPCDPGCA organized Medical camps at various hamlets like Kangarumamidi, Santhari, Chinnaburuguputu, Barapalli, Kamayyapeta, Bonduguda, Majjivalasa, Pattigaravu, Baluroda etc of Hukumpeta Mandal and screened about 8400 persons for hemoglobin levels. Twenty faculty members and nearly 200 students along with NSS and NCC actively participated in this program.</p>
    
    <p>The services rendered to tribal population by the institute was appreciated by Dist. Collector, ASR District and requested GVPCDPGCA to conduct medical camp for the District officials at the district HQ, Paderu. Two medical camps for District officials on 01-04-23 and 07-08-23 where 450 employees availed the services.</p>
    
    <p>About 10-20 students along with 3 to 4 faculty members participate in every camp from the GVPCDPGCA and volunteer their services to monitor and organize the smooth conduction of camps. During all these medical camps, the Doctors identified that majority of the population were suffering with anemia and one of the causes for this might be Sickle Cell Disease (SCD).</p>
    
    <p>SCD being a dreaded disease debilitating the effected persons and limiting their lifestyle and often proving to be fatal too. It was decided to undertake Pilot Project on Sickle Cell Disease Management among the Tribal population in ASR District starting with Hukumpeta Mandal. GVPCDPGCA submitted a proposal to Dist. Collector Mr. Sumit Kumar Gandhi who after thorough study of the proposal, granted permissions to conduct Medical camps for SCD screening in all the Gram panchayats of Hukumpeta Mandal. The proposal includes:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Screening and diagnosis of SCD or traits</li>
        <li>Creating awareness on SCD, anaemic conditions, physical and societal problems associated with SCD.</li>
        <li>Continuous monitoring of health and other complications among effected persons using a customized app.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The first SCD screening camp was conducted in Majjivalasa on 12-02-23. District officials, Faulty members and 30 students involved in organizing the camp. Till date, 16 SCD screening camps have been conducted in Tribal residential school premises of Hukumpeta mandal covering about 2460 persons, identified 11 SCD positive cases and 223 persons with SCD traits. All X class students, pregnant women and lactating women from G. Boddaputtu and Bakuru School Complex have been covered.</p>
    
    <p>The Medical Board Recommended Pension for SCD positive persons. Based on the inputs gathered during the screening camps, a road map has been developed with the objectives of:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Controlling the severity of the disease in the people identified with SCD through regular monitoring and provision of access to timely healthcare and thereby improve their quality of life.</li>
        <li>Preventing the spread of the disease by creating awareness among the vulnerable population and extensive counselling to discourage consanguine marriages which are major cause for the spread of the disease.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>In this direction, students and faculty take up counselling and education sessions to the SCD affected persons and their families on the need to control the spread of the disease and strategies to support them in managing the disease. This program will be continued for a minimum period of 5 years.</p>

    <p>The uniqueness of this practice offers a multifaceted approach that combines academic excellence, community. This practice aligns with the nation's emphasis on community outreach, service learning and fostering a deep sense of social responsibility among students.</p>

    <p>Some problems encountered in taking this program forward are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>During the organization of SCD camps, accessing the tribal community residing in remote locations to attend screening/health camps.</li>
        <li>Financial constraints to conduct medical camps at remote locations having poor road connectivity.</li>
        <li>Mobilization of pregnant and lactating women to camps.</li>
        <li>To build confidence of the local population to seek help of our volunteers.</li>
        <li>Seeking cooperation of government officials and NGOs.</li>
        <li>Procurement of Testing kits for the detection of SCD and administration of confirmation test using HPLC.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Overcoming all these problems have provided valuable insights to the students about the living conditions and problems of the people residing in tribal areas. This has enhanced their sensitivity to social issues and instilled social responsiveness. The practice has enhanced students’ behavior pattern by fostering a sense of community responsibility and has contributed to character building and lifelong commitment to learning. We consider this as an essential step on the path to Vikasit Bharath.</p>
