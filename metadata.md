Director’s desk
     
The year 2011 marked the beginning of Engineering courses in Gayatri Vidya Parishad for Degree and PG Courses (A). This institution was created with an objective of providing an outstanding and holistic learning experience in education along with humanitarian aspects such as character building, leadership, extra and co-curricular activities. Gayatri Vidya Parishad is equipped with a very strong, dedicated and capable team of educators, who became the driving force in the growth of the institution.
We take pride in sharing that most of our students who graduated from the institution in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 have acquired on-campus/off-campus jobs and accomplished awards/achievements in their respective organisations of work. Few graduates have completed/ joined higher institutions of learning in India and abroad and secured jobs. A couple of graduates have established own startup’s thus initiating a culture of entrepreneurship and innovative thinking. Along with their academic schedule students participate in hackathons, workshops and seminars by eminent persons from the industry to keep abreast of new technologies.
We also have NSS, NCC programs which help the present generation to stay disciplined and closely connected to the society.
I take this opportunity to ask all staff and students to take the most of this learning opportunity by investing time, hard work and dedication to keep up the quality and live up to the vision of the institution.
